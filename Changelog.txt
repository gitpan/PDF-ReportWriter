CHANGELOG

Version 0.3, released 08-May-2005
    
    Bold & Centre field headers
    Fixed bug in page counting that would 'remember' ( somehow ) the page count from previous reports
    Do page footers in a separate pass when saving so we can write 'Page N of M' instead of just 'Page N'

Version 0.2, released 27-Apr-2005
    
    Fixed bug in group handling that was preventing the special 'GrandTotal' group header from being rendered
    Added a much-requested demo application

    First Version :)
    Table-based text layout engine with cell borders
    Text alignment inside cells
    Basic aggregate commands ( sum, count )
    Page headers / footers
    Group headers / footers ( unlimited )
