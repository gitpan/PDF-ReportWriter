CHANGELOG

Version 0.5, released 15-Jun-2005
    
    Added support for images - scaled to fit to the current cell ( not finalised - comments welcome )
    Support multiple 'render_data' operations - you can keep passing new data ( or new groups / fields / data )
    Added support for colour
    Added support colour_func - a user-defined function to set the colour based on the current data
    
Version 0.4, released 09-May-2005
    
    Check for group footer definitions in final run before actually calling group_footer() on them
    Added currency:no_fill field type ... if you don't want your amounts filled out to 2 decimal places
    Remove requirement of setting the 'text' key to the group name for aggregate results in group footers
    
Version 0.3, released 08-May-2005
    
    Bold & Centre field headers
    Fixed bug in page counting that would 'remember' ( somehow ) the page count from previous reports
    Do page footers in a separate pass when saving so we can write 'Page N of M' instead of just 'Page N'

Version 0.2, released 27-Apr-2005
    
    Fixed bug in group handling that was preventing the special 'GrandTotal' group header from being rendered
    Added a much-requested demo application
    
Version 0.1, released 26-Apr-2005

    First Version :)
    Table-based text layout engine with cell borders
    Text alignment inside cells
    Basic aggregate commands ( sum, count )
    Page headers / footers
    Group headers / footers ( unlimited )
    POD documentation
