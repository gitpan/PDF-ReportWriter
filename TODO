- PDF indexing thingy support
    We could put things like group headers into the index
    This would make it easier to navigate a large report
    Does PDF::API2 support this? Investigate ...
    
- Perl Gtk2 - based report builder ( medium-term )
    Now that Cosimo has added XML support, it's time to add a GUI report builder
    At the moment, a simple expandable-tree type of GUI would be good.
    I don't think I'm up to a WYSIWYG editor at present. We'll see
    
- Re-arrange cell definitions
    It would be nice to clean up the definitions somewhat. eg:
    
    $self->{data}->{fields} could be expanded to something like:
    
    $self->{data}->{field_definitions} = {
                                            cells           => $array_of_cells, # <== old $self->{data}->{fields}   
                                            upper_buffer    => $upper_buffer,
                                            lower_buffer    => $lower_buffer
                                         };
    
    This not only looks cleaner and removes general clutter, but it makes it easier to deal
    with different objects in a more generic way, which is always good. It's a pitty I didn't
    do this from the start ...
    
    Would this just break things for no reason other than cleanliness?
    
- Clean up definitions of buffers
    Current approach is fragmented. Each cell should have:
    
    {
        internal_buffers => {
                                upper   => 0,
                                lower   => 0,
                                left    => 0,
                                right   => 0
                            },
        external_buffers => {
                                left    => 0,
                                lower   => 0
                            }
    }
    
    internal_buffers should apply to text ( currently text_whitespace )
    and *maybe* also images ( currently in images->{buffer} )
    
    external_buffers should affect the initial cell definitions

- Further optimisation for images:
    Cache image metadata in a hash with the image path as the key.
    We current cache this against the actual cell ( cell->{image}->{tmp} ), but this is
    only useful if the same image is encountered in the same cell, and directly after the
    last rendering of this image ... ie if another image is rendered in this cell, the image
    metadata is overwritten and we have to run imgsize() again
    
* * * Things that could be done * * * :

- Optimisation: we currently do a regex for *EACH* field with borders.
    We should move this into setup_cell_definitions() and store the results.
    Apparently regex is a little expensive.
    
- Support calculating a header's row that contains an unscaled image when determining our $y_needed
    This situation should be quite rare, and it would need a different approach
    We'd have to do a dummy render_row pass on each header, or else break out our calculation into
    another function?
    NEWSFLASH: We may have already fixed this bug!
    Check by actually putting unscaled images in a header, and see what happens.

- Add support for custom aggregate functions
    This was previously requested, but I'm having difficulty actually coming up with a use.
    If someone gives me an example of a custom function they might want to make use of, I'll
    consider how I'm going to hook things up
    
- Add support for defining paper size per *render* operation instead of per pdf
    This could be a little tricky with page footers, which are processed after the rest of the
    report is rendered. Does anyone actually want this functionality? Personally I have no reason,
    but I've added it as a possibility anyway

- Allow different templates (Cosimo)
    Allow to define a list of templates to be rotated between pages?
    (for example even/odd pages with different templates)

- Hyperlinks on images and text (Cosimo)

- Phantom group fields (Cosimo)
    Now if we define groups on data fields, we must include those fields in the
    main detail table. Can we define a way to make those grouped fields disappear
    avoiding their rendering?

- Custom cell formatting (Cosimo)
    Document the new cell type "custom:{class}" with its API.
    Should work as follows:

       my $obj = {class}->new();
       $string = $obj->format($cell, $options, $string);

- Text line height (Cosimo)
    When handling multi-line text, is there some property that tells us how much
    to go down in the page? Now font line height is empirically calculated as:
        
        line_height = font_size * 1.2
